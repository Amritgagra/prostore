## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer (recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js). You can also use pnpm or yarn if you prefer.

## Getting started (PowerShell)

Open a terminal in the project root (`c:\Users\hp\Desktop\ecomm\ecomm`) and run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Available npm scripts (from `package.json`):

- `npm run dev` — start the Next.js dev server (Turbopack)
- `npm run build` — build for production
- `npm run start` — start the production server after building
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint

## Build & production

Build the app:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Start the built app:

```powershell
npm run start
```

## Styling (Tailwind)

Tailwind is included as a development dependency. Global styles are in `app/globals.css`. If you need to adjust Tailwind settings, check or create a `tailwind.config.js` / `tailwind.config.cjs` file in the project root.

## Environment variables

This starter doesn't require any environment variables by default. If you integrate services (Stripe, CMS, auth), create a `.env.local` in the project root and add your keys there. Example:

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Remember to add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

## Linting & Types

TypeScript and ESLint are included. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues. Add or tweak rules in the ESLint config if you have team preferences.

## Testing

There are no tests included by default. Recommended next steps:

- Add unit tests with Vitest or Jest.
- Add component/e2e tests with Playwright or Cypress.

## Deployment

Recommended: Vercel — it has first-class Next.js support and will automatically detect this project. Other hosts (Netlify, Render, Fly) also work.

General steps for Vercel:

1. Push the repository to GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket.
2. Import the repo in Vercel and configure environment variables if needed.
3. Vercel will run `npm run build` and deploy the output.

## Contributing

Small, clear contributions welcome. A suggested flow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit changes and open a pull request

If you want, I can add a CONTRIBUTING.md and a GitHub workflow for CI.
