<!-- Project README for ProStore -->

# ProStore

Professional e-commerce starter built with Next.js (App Router), React 19 and Tailwind CSS. This repository contains a minimal, modern storefront layout and developer setup so you can prototype or ship quickly.

Short, focused, and production-ready defaults so you can build features instead of configuration.

---

## Quick overview

- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- UI: React 19
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Bundler: Turbopack (used in the dev/build scripts)

Project name: `prostore` (see `package.json`).

## Features

- App directory routing (Next.js App Router)
- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling
- Turbopack for fast local development
- Minimal, accessible layout (see `app/layout.tsx` and `app/page.tsx`)

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer (recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js). You can also use pnpm or yarn if you prefer.

## Getting started (PowerShell)

Open a terminal in the project root (`c:\Users\hp\Desktop\ecomm\ecomm`) and run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Available npm scripts (from `package.json`):

- `npm run dev` — start the Next.js dev server (Turbopack)
- `npm run build` — build for production
- `npm run start` — start the production server after building
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint

## Build & production

Build the app:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Start the built app:

```powershell
npm run start
```

## Styling (Tailwind)

Tailwind is included as a development dependency. Global styles are in `app/globals.css`. If you need to adjust Tailwind settings, check or create a `tailwind.config.js` / `tailwind.config.cjs` file in the project root.

## Project structure (high level)

- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages & layout
	- `layout.tsx` — root layout
	- `page.tsx` — homepage
	- `globals.css` — global styles
- `public/` — static assets (images, favicons)
- `next.config.ts` — Next.js configuration
- `package.json` — scripts & dependencies

## Environment variables

This starter doesn't require any environment variables by default. If you integrate services (Stripe, CMS, auth), create a `.env.local` in the project root and add your keys there. Example:

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Remember to add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

## Linting & Types

TypeScript and ESLint are included. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues. Add or tweak rules in the ESLint config if you have team preferences.

## Testing

There are no tests included by default. Recommended next steps:

- Add unit tests with Vitest or Jest.
- Add component/e2e tests with Playwright or Cypress.

## Deployment

Recommended: Vercel — it has first-class Next.js support and will automatically detect this project. Other hosts (Netlify, Render, Fly) also work.

General steps for Vercel:

1. Push the repository to GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket.
2. Import the repo in Vercel and configure environment variables if needed.
3. Vercel will run `npm run build` and deploy the output.

## Contributing

Small, clear contributions welcome. A suggested flow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit changes and open a pull request

If you want, I can add a CONTRIBUTING.md and a GitHub workflow for CI.

## Notes & next steps

- Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT is a common default) if you plan to open-source this project.
- Add example environment files and sample data for local development.
- Add screenshots or a short demo GIF to this README to make the project more approachable.

---

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT)
- Generate a `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Add basic unit tests and a CI workflow

Tell me which of those you'd like next and I'll implement it.
